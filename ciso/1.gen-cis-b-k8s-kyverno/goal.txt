I would like to check if the following condition is satisfiled, given a Kubernetes cluster with `kubeconfig.yaml`
    Minimize the admission of containers wishing to share the host network namespace.

To check the condition, do the following steps. 
- deploy a Kyverno policy to the cluster
- chcek if the policy is correctly deployed. 

If deploying the policy failed and if you can fix the issue, you will do it and try deploying again.
Once you get a final answer, you can quit the work.

The cluster's kubeconfig is at `/tmp/kubeconfig.agent.yaml`.

You can use \'/tmp/agent-workspace\' as your workdir.
